  <h3>History:</h3>
  <p>May 6, 1938: Adolf Hitler lays the foundation stone of the Volkswagen factory. On far right: Ferdinand Porsche
    1932–1940: People's Car project
    Volkswagen was established in 1937 by the German Labour Front (German: Deutsche Arbeitsfront) as part of the Strength Through Joy (German: Kraft durch Freude) program in Berlin.[4] In the early 1930s, cars were a luxury – most Germans could afford nothing more elaborate than a motorcycle, and only one German out of 50 owned a car. Seeking a potential new market, some car makers began independent "people's car" projects – the Mercedes 170H, BMW 3/15, Adler AutoBahn, Steyr 55 and Hanomag 1.3L, among others.</p>
